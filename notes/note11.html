<h3>Coming Soon...</h3>
<p>Plans are in the mix for support of the following features:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>@Media Queries</strong></li>
    <p>So you can style your email for the ipad, iphone, and android lovers in your list.</p>
    <li><strong>Embedded Video</strong> (not just animated gifs)</li>
    <p>There are more and more email clients that are supporting the HTML5 spec.  That means possible native support for actually playing a video inside an email. We'll get video working where it should and a backup image w/ link when video isn't available.</p>
    <li><strong>And more to come!</strong></li>
</ul>
